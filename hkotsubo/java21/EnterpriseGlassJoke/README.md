This is an "enterprise" implementation of the glass code joke.

It has lots of unnecessary, clutter-ish, over-engineered code, with bunch of useless factories, builders, interfaces, hierarchy and all sorts of so called "good practices" applied in a distorted way.

Yes, it's inspired by [Enterprise FizzBuzz](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition), but with *way* less clutter. Maybe someday we can refactor this project and "over-enterprise it" to the same level. But for now, I believe it's enough for the joke.

To execute it, run `mvn exec:java`.
